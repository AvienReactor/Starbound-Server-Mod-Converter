# Starbound-Server-Mod-Converter
This is a program to make it easier for a user to bring workshop mods from steam to your starbound server.
Here is a youtube video similar to what my program does (https://youtu.be/vgI0zmOkR8I). My program works like their "Steam Workshop Fix" except mine is mean for the non workshop way. Where you put your workshop mods in the "mods" folder on your server. It only accepts (*.pak*) files. When you run my program you have a Input and Output field to select. After inpupting the locations you have two options to choose from: *Convert To PKA /wo empty* (will convert the files without deleting the Input directory) and *Convert To PKA /w empty* (will convert the files and delete everything in the Input directory).
